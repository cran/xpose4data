\title{Read the vpctab file from PsN into Xpose}
\description{
  This function read in the vpctab file created from PsN and gathers the
  information needed to make a vpc plot.
}
\usage{
read.vpctab(vpctab=NULL,
            object=NULL,
            vpc.name="vpctab",
            vpc.suffix="",
            tab.suffix="",
            inclZeroWRES=FALSE,
            ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{vpctab}{The vpctab file from a '\code{vpc}' run in PsN.}
  \item{object}{An xpose data object. Created from
    \code{\link[xpose4data]{xpose.data}}.  One of \code{object} or
    \code{vpctab} is required.  If both are present then the information
    from the \code{vpctab} will over-ride the xpose data
    object \code{object} (i.e. the values from the vpctab will replace any
    matching values in the \code{object@Data} portion of the xpose data
    object). If only \code{object} is present then the function will
    look for a vpctab with the same run number as the one associated
    with the object.}
  \item{vpc.name}{The default name of the vpctab file. Used if only
    \code{object} is supplied.}
  \item{vpc.suffix}{The suffix of the vpctab file. Used if only
    \code{object} is supplied.}
  \item{tab.suffix}{ The table suffix of the vpctab file. Used if only
    \code{object} is supplied. Final order of the file would be then
    \code{paste(vpc.name,object@Runno,vpc.suffix,tab.suffix)}}
  \item{inclZeroWRES}{If there are no zero valued weighted resuiduals in
    the \code{object} then this should be \code{TRUE}.}
  \item{\dots}{Other arguments passed to other functions.}
}
\details{
}
\value{
  Returned is an xpose data object with vpctab information included.
