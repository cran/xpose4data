\title{Class xpose.data}
\description{The xpose.data class is the fundamental data object in
  Xpose 4. It contains the data and preferences used in the creation of
  the Xpose plots and analyses.}
\section{Objects from the Class}{
  Objects are most easily created by the \code{xpose.data} function, whcih
  reads the appropriate NONMEM table files and populates the slots of
  the object.
}
\section{Slots}{
  \describe{
    \item{\code{Runno:}}{Object of class \code{"character or numeric"}
      The run number identifying the NONMEM run from which the data in
      the object comes from.}
    \item{\code{Data}:}{Object of class \code{"data.frame or NULL"} This
    slot holds the (merged) data, in the form of a regular data.frame,
    from the NONMEM table files generated from the NONMEM run. It can be
    accessed and set using the \code{\link[xpose4data]{Data}} function.}
    \item{\code{SData}:}{Object of class \code{"data.frame or NULL"} A
      data.frame of any data simulated from the model. It can be
    accessed and set using the \code{\link[xpose4data]{SData}} function.The number of
      rows should be an even multiple of the rows in Data and the column
    names should be exactly the same as in Data, except that one extra
    column should be present ("iter"). The extra column consists of integers
    that identifies the iteration the row belongs to.}
    \item{\code{Nsim}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric or NULL"} A
      number that indicates the number of simulated data sets in SData.}
    \item{\code{Prefs}:}{Object of class \code{"xpose.prefs"} An object
      that contains a number of data and graphical preferences for the
      xpose.data object.}
    \item{\code{Doc}:}{Object of class \code{"character or NULL"}
      A short piece of text describing the model.}
