\title{Read the results file from a Numerical or Visual Predictive Check
run in PsN}
\description{ This function reads in a results file from running either the PsN command
\code{vpc} or \code{npc}.  The function then parses the file and passes
the result to plotting functions.
}
\usage{
read.npc.vpc.results(vpc.results = NULL, npc.results = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{vpc.results}{The name of the results file from running the PsN
    command \code{vcp}.  Often this is named \file{vpc\_results.csv}.
    If the file is in a directory different then the
    working directory then you can define a relative or absolute path
    to the file by, for example, \file{./vpc\_strat\_WT\_4\_mirror\_5/vpc\_results.csv}.}
  \item{npc.results}{The name of the results file from running the PsN
    command \code{npc}.  Often this is named \file{npc\_results.csv}.
    relative or absolute paths to the file are allowed
    as for \code{vpc.results}.}
  \item{\dots}{arguments passed to other functions.}
}
\details{
One of \code{vpc.results} or \code{npc.results} are necessary.  If both
or none are defined then the function does nothing and a \code{NULL} is
returned from the function.
}
\value{
  A list of values is returned.
  \item{model.file }{The model file that PsN ran either the \code{npc}
    or \code{vpc} with}
  \item{dv.var }{The dependent variable used in the calculations.}
  \item{idv.var }{The independent variable used in the
    calculations. \code{NULL} if \code{npc.results} is used.}
  \item{num.tables }{The number of separate tables in the results file.}
  \item{by.interval }{The conditioning interval for the stratification
    variable, only returned if \code{vpc.results} is used.}
  \item{result.tables }{The results tables from the results file.  this
  is a list.}
