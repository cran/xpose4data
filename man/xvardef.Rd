\title{Extracts and set Xpose variable definitions.}
\description{
  This function extracts and set Xpose variable definitions in "xpose.data" objects.
}
\usage{
xvardef(x, object)

xvardef(object) <- value
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{The name of an xpose variable (see below).}
  \item{object}{An \code{xpose.data} object. }
  \item{value}{A two element vector of which the first element is the
    name of the variable and the second the column name in the Data slot
    of the object.}
}
\details{
  The Xpose variable definitions are used to map particular variable
  types to column names in the data.frame in the Data slot of the
  "xpose.data" object. The single-valued Xpose variable definitions are:
  \code{id, idlab, idv, occ, dv, pred, ipred, iwres, res}. The
  (potentially) vector-valued Xpose variable definitions are:
  \code{parms, covariates, ranpar, tvparms} (parameters, covariates,
  random effects parameters=etas, typical value parameters). The default
  values of these can be found in the \code{createXposeClasses}
  function.
}
\value{
  Returns a string with the name of the data variable defined as the
  Xpose data variable.

\examples{
\dontrun{
## xpdb5 is an Xpose data object
## We expect to find the required NONMEM run and table files for run
## 5 in the current working directory
xpdb5 <- xpose.data(5)

## get the column name in the Data slot of object xpdb5
## corresponding to the label dv
xvardef("dv", xpdb5)

## reset the which column the label dv points to in the Data slot of
## object xpdb5
xvardef(xpdb5) <- c("dv", "DVA")
